                <h1>Steps to Upload Files</h1>
                <p>Depending on your hosting provider, you typically use the following steps to upload files:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Access your hosting provider's logon page.</li>
                    <li>Log on to your account.</li>
                    <li>Access the file management feature on your control panel.</li>
                    <li>Select the web root folder for your website.</li>
                    <li>If required, create a new subfolder to contain your pages.</li>
                    <li>Use the file upload feature to upload a copy of your files to your web folder.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            
            <section>
                <h1>Website URL</h1>
                <p>For users to access your website, they must enter the URL, including any subfolders. If you use <em>index</em> as the filename for your landing page, users typically do not have to include the filename in the URL.</p>
                <p>For example, if you post an <span class="screenElement">index.html</span> page in a <span class="screenElement">public_html/webtips</span> folder in your hosting account (where <span class="screenElement">public_html</span> is the name of your web root folder), a user can simply enter a URL similar to <span class="screenElement">www.engl4814.com/webtips</span>.</p>
