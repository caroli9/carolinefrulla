                <p>I am a professional and technical writer with a digital mind. I have experience with technical documentation and science writing as well as with marketing strategies. I believe that the design of how a message is presented is just as important as the content of that message. I also believe that writing should be visually interactive regardless of whether it is online or in print, and that readers should experience it in a beautiful, simple, and visually fun way.</p>
                <p>I am currently pursuing a B.A. in Professional and Technical Writing and a B.A. in English Literature and Language, and have a background in computer science. My experience and education has allowed me to develop a passion for helping organizations spread their values and messages in and through their content.</p>
                <p>Feel free to download my resume, check out my LinkedIn profile and browse through my portfolio to get a feel for my technical writing and marketing experience. Contact me if you would like writing samples or to work together!</p>
